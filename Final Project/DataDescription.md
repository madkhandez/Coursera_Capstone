The source used for this project will be from :
1. Patient database from existing hospital
2. Coordinates (geocoder)

From the source above, the resulted data will be used to solve the problem are:
1. Neighborhood : collection of regional data involved state, latitude, longitude. That will be a master data.
2. Patient profiles : the basic information of patient such as regional, sex, dob, and location (lat,long) that will be clustering and correlating to neighborhood data.
3. Patient visit histories : the infomation about patient's transaction in hospital, that will be main data to analyze to solve the problem

From data above, it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location, patients demography, demand and behaviour of healthcare. These kind of analysis can be done using the data, by studying the complicated factors.
