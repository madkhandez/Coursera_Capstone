## Mayapada Hospital Patients Analysis
Madkhan Kamal

This is my client, Mayapada Hospital. A popular hospital in South Jakarta, Indonesia. They want to expand the hospitals all around the State of Jakarta. Board ask me to mapping the patients data they have. Here are the problem:
- Does the demography of an area matters?
- Are any neighborhoods similar based on the type of patient?
- Any strong correlation on patient profiles?
- What kind of a service is more popular in a locality?

With these questions in mind we will try to find out the factors that would affect opening of a new hospitals in
a locality.
